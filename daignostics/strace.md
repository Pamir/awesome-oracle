### What is strace
Strace is a powerful diagnostic and debugging utility for Linux, used to monitor and analyze interactions between processes and the operating system

### Tracing LogWriter Process
```bash
ps -ef | grep lgwr
ps -ef | grep lg00
strace -c -p 23484
```
- trace lg00 or lg0x process. On multiprocessor systems, LGWR creates worker processes to improve the performance of writing to the redo log. LGWR workers are not used when there is a SYNC standby destination.

- From the output above it is clear that logwrite could not find anything Ä±n the logbuffer to write it to the disk. Now execute the SQL Statement to trigger log writer to trace with strace tool

```SQL
CREATE TABLE OrderTable(OrderID, StaffID, CustomerID, TotalOrderValue)
as (select level, ceil(dbms_random.value(0, 1000)), 
                  ceil(dbms_random.value(0,10000)), 
                  round(dbms_random.value(0,10000),2) 
    from dual 
    connect by level <= 1000000)
/
```
